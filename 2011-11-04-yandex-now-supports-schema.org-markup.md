<p>One of the primary goals in creating schema.org was to simplify structured data markup requirements for content creators across search engines, which we hope will drive greater adoption across the Web. In that vein, we're very happy that <a href="http://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a> has announced its <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/?id=1122752">support</a> for schema.org. In addition to being a major consumer of schema.org markup, Yandex will be increasingly contributing to discussions about the evolution of the schema on the <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/10/w3c-web-schemas-group-is-our-new-public.html">W3C-hosted Web Schemas group</a>, and they are also investigating translation of the schema.org website to local languages. It's great to have growing support for the schema.org markup around the world!</p>
