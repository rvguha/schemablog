Version v1.93 of schema.org has just been <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.93">released</a>.  As we mentioned in the <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/12/schemaorg-v192-music-video-games-sports.html">previous update</a> we are working towards a stable "version 2" release. This isn't yet v2.0, but it serves as a foundation,</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">

fixing a variety of small issues across many schemas and examples. </div>

This release also introduces new vocabulary for describing visual artworks: a new <a href="http://schema.org/VisualArtwork">VisualArtwork</a> type alongside supporting properties - <a href="http://schema.org/artEdition">artEdition</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/artform">artform</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/material">material</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/surface">surface</a>.  Many thanks to Paul Watson for leading that work.

Invoices and bills also now have dedicated vocabulary in schema.org, see the new <a href="http://schema.org/Invoice">Invoice</a> type for details. This addresses situations when an invoice is received that is not directly attached to an Order, for example utility bills.</div>
