title: "Using RDFa 1.1 Lite with Schema.org"
date: 2011-11-11

<p>As a result of our continued discussions and collaborations with publishers, implementers and standards-makers, we're pleased to give advance notice of a new way of adopting schema.org's structured data vocabulary. W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/">RDF Web Applications</a> group are right now putting the finishing touches to the latest version of the RDFa standard. This work opens up new possibilities also for developers who intend to work with schema.org data using RDF-based tools and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data">Linked Data</a>, and defines a simplified publisher-friendly 'Lite' view of RDFa.<br /><br />Early adopters can follow the in-progress drafts (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-core/Overview-src.html">rdfa-core</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/02/rdfa/sources/rdfa-lite/Overview-src.html">rdfa-lite</a>) while the W3C group work through the remaining details. We hope that our support for 'RDFa Lite', alongside Microdata, will allow publishers to focus more on what they want to <span style="font-style: italic;">say</span> with their data, rather than on the details of its specific encoding as markup. We also want to take a moment to thank the members of the RDFa community for taking on board our feedback; making standards is hard work, and we believe this latest version of RDFa is a major contribution to the Web of structured data.</p>
