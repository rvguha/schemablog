<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.5">Schema.org version 3.5</a> has been released. This release moves a number of terms from  the experimental "<a href="https://pending.schema.org/">Pending</a>" area into the Schema.org core. It also <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/2019Mar/0049.html">simplifies and clarifies</a> the Schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/extension.html">extension</a> model, reducing our emphasis on using named subdomains for topical groups of schemas. New terms introduced in Pending area include improvements for describing projects, grants and funding agencies; for describing open-ended date ranges (e.g. datasets); and a substantial vocabulary for <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/eocred-schema/">Educational and Occupational Credentials</a>. Many thanks to all who contributed!
