<br />
When we launched <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> almost 3 years ago, our main focus was on providing vocabularies for describing entities --- people, places, movies, restaurants, ...  But the Web is not just about static descriptions of entities. It is about taking action on these entities --- from making a reservation to watching a movie to commenting on a post.<br />
<br />
Today, we are excited to start the next chapter of schema.org and structured data on the Web by introducing vocabulary that enables websites to describe the actions they enable and how these actions can be invoked. <br />
<br />
The new actions vocabulary is the result of over two years of intense collaboration and debate amongst the schema.org partners and the larger Web community. Many thanks to all those who participated in these discussions, in particular to members of the Web Schemas and Hydra groups at W3C. We are hopeful that these additions to schema.org will help unleash new categories of applications.<br />
