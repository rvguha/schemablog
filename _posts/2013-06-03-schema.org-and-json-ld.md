<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
We'd like to take a minute to share our enthusiasm for some recent work at W3C: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntax/">JSON-LD</a>.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> is all about shared vocabulary - it helps integrate data across applications, Web sites and data formats. We are adding JSON-LD to the list of formats we recommend for use with schema.org, alongside Microdata and RDFa - each has strengths and weaknesses for different usage scenarios.<br />
<br />
In HTML, schema.org descriptions can be written using markup attributes in HTML (i.e. RDFa and Microdata). However there are often cases when data is exchanged in pure JSON or as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntax/#embedding-json-ld-in-html-documents">JSON within HTML</a>. W3C's work on JSON-LD provides mechanisms for interpreting structured data in JSON that promotes interoperability with other data formats. We believe it provides value for developers and publishers, and improves the flow of information between JSON and other environments.
<br />
<br />
There are some technical <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld-syntax/#the-context">details</a> to work through on how exactly schema.org terms are defined for JSON-LD usage, but it is already clear that JSON-LD is a useful contribution to structured data sharing in the Web. Many thanks to the hardworking W3C community for creating the specification.</div>
