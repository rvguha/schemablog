<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
We are happy to announce version <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.92">v1.92</a> of <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>. With this update we "soft launch" a substantial collection of improvements that will form the basis for a <i>schema.org version 2.0</i> release in early 2015. There remain a number of site-wide improvements, bugfixes and clarifications that we'd like to make before we feel ready to use the name "v2.0". However the core vocabulary improvements are stable and available for use from today. As usual see the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v1.92">release notes page</a> for details.<br />
<br />
Please get in touch via the W3C <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/">Web Schemas group</a> or our <a href="https://github.com/rvguha/schemaorg/issues">Github issue</a> <a href="https://github.com/rvguha/schemaorg/issues">tracker</a> if you'd like to share feedback with us and the wider schema.org community. We won't go into the details of each update in today's blog post, but there are a lot of additions and fixes, and more coming in 2015. Many thanks to all those who contributed to this release!</div>
