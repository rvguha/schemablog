<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Various members of the W3C Web Schemas group (where we collaborate on improvements to schema.org) are at the <a href="http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/">International Semantic Web</a> conference in Sydney this week. If you're at the conference, we've arranged for an ad-hoc vocabulary collaboration room to be available on thursday and friday. Feel free to make use of the room during those times for any discussions around Web Schemas, schema.org and related technologies, and to the W3C wiki to suggest topics... </span><br />
