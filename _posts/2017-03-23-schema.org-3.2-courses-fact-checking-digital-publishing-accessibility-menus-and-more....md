<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
Schema.org 3.2 is released! This update brings many improvements including new vocabulary for describing courses, fact-check <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">reviews</a>, digital publishing accessibility, as well as a more thorough treatment of menus and a large number of <i>pending</i> proposals which are offered for early-access use, evaluation and improvement. We also introduce a new "hosted extension" area, <a href="http://iot.schema.org/"><span>iot.schema.org</span></a> which provides an entry point for schema collaborations relating to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a> field. As always, our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.2">releases page</a> has full details.<br />
<br />
These efforts depend entirely on a growing network of collaborations, within <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">our own</a> W3C Community Group and beyond. Many thanks are due to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schema-course-extend/">Schema Course Extension</a> Community Group, the <a href="http://idpf.org/">IDPF</a>'s <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html">Epub Accessibility</a> Working Group, members of the international <a href="https://www.poynter.org/about-the-international-fact-checking-network/">fact-checking network</a> including the <a href="http://reporterslab.org/">Duke Reporters Lab</a> and <a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a>, the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Main_Page">Spatial Web</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://bioschemas.org/">Bioschemas</a> project, and to Wikipedia's <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> project.<br />
<br />
This release also provides the opportunity to thank two of our longest-serving <a href="http://schema.org/docs/about.html">steering group</a> members, whose careers have moved on from the world of structured data markup. Peter Mika and Martin Hepp have both played leading roles in Schema.org since its earliest days, and the project has benefited greatly from their insight, commitment and attention to detail.<br />
<br />
As we look towards future developments, it is worth taking a brief recap on how we have organized things recently. Schema.org's primary discussion forum is a W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">group</a>, although its most detailed collaborations are typically in <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">Github</a>, organized around specific <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">issues</a> and proposed changes. These discussions are open to all interested parties. Schema designs frequently draw upon related groups that have a more specific topical focus. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schema-course-extend/">Courses</a> group became a hub for education/learning metadata experts from <a href="http://lrmi.dublincore.net/">LRMI</a> and others. This need to engage with relevant experts also motivated the creation of the "<a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending</a>" area <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2016/08/schemaorg-update-hotels-datasets-health.html">introduced</a> in our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.1">previous</a> release. Github is a site oriented towards computer programmers. By surfacing proposed, experimental and other early access designs at <a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending.schema.org</a> we hope we can reach a wider audience who may have insight to share. With today's <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html">release</a>, we add 14 new "pending" designs, with courses, accessibility and fact-checking markup graduating from <a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending</a> into the core section of schema.org. Future releases will follow this pipeline approach, encouraging greater consistency, quality and clarity as our vocabulary continues to evolve.<br />
