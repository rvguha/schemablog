<a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> version 1.0d has been published. This release brings a number of practical additions and improvements - here's a high level overview. As always, the schema.org site has a <a href="http://schema.org/docs/full.html">full listing</a> of the entire vocabulary, and W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas">WebSchemas group</a> has details of the background discussions.<br />
<br />
<b>Civic Services</b>. As we <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/08/vocabulary-for-describing-civic-services.html">described earlier</a>, this work provides vocabulary such as <a href="http://schema.org/GovernmentService">GovernmentService</a> for describing services of various kinds. As part of this work, we have also updated <a href="http://schema.org/ContactPoint">ContactPoint</a>, which now for example provides a mechanism for describing contact points for services which support users with hearing impairments.<br />
<br />
<b>TV/Radio</b>. These long-awaited changes bring a number of adjustments to the existing schema.org vocabulary for TV, including adding parent types such as <a href="http://schema.org/Series">Series</a> with distinct types for <a href="http://schema.org/RadioSeries">RadioSeries</a> and <a href="http://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>. Many thanks are due to Yves Raimond (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd">BBC</a>) and Jean-Pierre Evain (<a href="http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/home">European Broadcasting Union</a>) for leading this work.<br />
<br />
We also made a small but useful improvement to the <a href="http://schema.org/Organization"><b>Organization</b></a> type, by adding <a href="http://schema.org/department">department</a> and<br />
<a href="http://schema.org/subOrganization">subOrganization</a> properties that relate organizations to each other. This can be used when describing common situations such as a bookshop containing a coffeeshop, or a larger store that includes a pharmacy, when details such as opening hours or contact information vary.<br />
<br />
Finally, we made some changes to the <a href="http://schema.org/Event"><b>Event</b></a> type, adding support - via an <a href="http://schema.org/eventStatus">eventStatus</a> property - for canceled, postponed or rescheduled events, as well as a <a href="http://schema.org/previousStartDate">previousStartDate</a> property to help describe rescheduled events more accurately.<br />
