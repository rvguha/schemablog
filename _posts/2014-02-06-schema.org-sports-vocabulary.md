<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Schema.org partners, in collaboration with experts from the BBC and IPTC/SportsML, are pleased to share a proposal for improving the Schema.org sports vocabulary.  The proposal includes support for describing <b>sports organizations</b>, <b>athletes</b>, and <b>events</b>, with a focus on the most common sports types being published on the Web today. Although the proposal includes support for describing sports
statistics within these domains, the initial set of properties are limited to
those which are broadly applicable.  More detailed, sport-specific
statistics will be the subject of future additions to the base statistic
classes.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Schema.org sports vocabulary proposal is available
as an exported PDF in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Sports" target="_blank">W3C Web Schemas - Sports wiki</a> and a machine readable version of the schema will be posted soon.  We encourage the web
community to review and provide feedback via the wiki, the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/" target="_blank">W3C public vocabs mailing list</a> (<a href="mailto:public-vocabs@w3.org">public-vocabs@w3.org</a>), or by joining the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sports-schema-collab" target="_blank">Schema.org sports vocabulary discussion group</a>.</span><br /></p>
